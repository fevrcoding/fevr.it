Mixed logic, cross-dependencies, and way too many edge cases to test. Wouldn't it be great to have a framework that helps you build a modular, consistent, and pluggable system? Enter Fastify, a web framework for Node.js. Fastify offers an extremely flexible plugin system that allows complete customization of the framework. Every plugin could be packaged as an independent module and then deployed as a microservice or as a part of a monolith. In this talk, you will learn all the concepts of Fastify and how they play together. Spoiler alert: opinions ahead!
