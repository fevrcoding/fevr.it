Web XR means to deliver AR experiences on the Web, using any browser, without even requiring to use specific devices, like headsets.
In this talk, I will show all technologies and platforms available, in 2021, to build Web XR experiences for free, highlighting pros/cons, devices, support and future plans for each of them. This talk has been thought to be a good way to start with WebAR.
